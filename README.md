# fired-up
 The concept behind repo is simple, to have a collection of  Desktop Wallpapers to keep me charged up while working and give 
 positive vibe to keep me moving. It's mostly for programmers and security peeps. For now it' just a random collection and no
 grouping (for e.g php,java, swift,c) but may add more later or if someone can be generous enough to do a PR of an awesome wallpaper,I 
 will surely merge it.
 
 I did not and will not add any kw3l/133t hoddies wallpaper as they were not giving any positive vibe. I like to keep it decent.
 
 If you have any wallpaper you want to add feel free to do PR and will add your name to contributors ;)
